# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get the fsscan up and running quickly.

## Quick Build & Run

### 1. Build Both Applications
```bash
cd "fsscan"
go run test_build.go

go build -o fs .
go build -o fs-demo ./cmd/demo
```

### 2. Test with Demo First
```bash
./fs-demo
./fs-demo ~/Documents
./fs-demo /usr/local
```

### 3. Run Full System Scan
```bash
./fs
sudo ./fs
```

## What You'll See

```

## Build Options

### Using Make (if available)
```bash
make build          
make build-demo     
make run           
make run-demo      
make run-sudo      
```

### Using Build Script
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

### Manual Build Commands
```bash
go build -o file-counter .
go build -o file-counter-demo ./cmd/demo

go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o file-counter .
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Errors
```bash
sudo ./file-counter
```

### Build Errors
```bash
rm -f file-counter file-counter-demo
go mod tidy
go build -o file-counter .
go build -o file-counter-demo ./cmd/demo
```

### Testing Build
```bash
go run test_build.go
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. **First Time Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd "fsscan"
   go run test_build.go
   ```

2. **Test on Small Directory**:
   ```bash
   ./fs-demo ~/Desktop
   ```

3. **Full System Scan**:
   ```bash
   ./fs
   sudo ./fs
   ```

4. **Stop Anytime**: Press `Ctrl+C` to stop gracefully

## Important Notes

- **Full system scan** can take **hours** on large systems
- **Root privileges** (`sudo`) required for complete access
- **Demo version** is perfect for testing before full scan
- **Press Ctrl+C** anytime to stop and see partial results
- **System directories** like `/proc`, `/sys` are automatically skipped for safety

## Need Help?

- Check `README.md` for detailed documentation
- Run `go run test_build.go` to verify your build
- Use demo version first: `./file-counter-demo .`
- For full system scan: `sudo ./file-counter`

Happy scanning
